Hello, here you can find examples of layouts that were made with Figma templates: https://varenyk-lover.github.io/Layouts-of-websites/

More info:
1. Productly layout — HTML, CSS. One of my first layouts.

2. Responsive Denis Novik layout — HTML, SCSS, JS. The task was also to make it responsive, adaptive and to find ready solution in JavaScript for burger navbar menu.

3. Animation cards — HTML, SCSS. The task was to create an animation for the cards so that they rotate in a random order.

4. Solis group layout with swipers — HTML, SCSS, JS. The task was to integrate slider or swiper. I chose swiper and integrate it to one of my templates.
